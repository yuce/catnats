# catnats

`cat` for [NATS](http://nats.io) gnatsd server. Works for both TLS and non-TLS connections.

## Requirements

Python 2.7.6+ or Python 3.4+ is required.

Non-TLS connections should work on all platforms. TLS connections requires:

* on Ubuntu 14.04, Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 works out of the box
* on OSX (El-Capitan) you need to install an updated version of Python with updated OpenSSL
using `brew install python --with-brewed-openssl`
* on Windows, Python 3.5 works

## Usage

`catnats.py [--quiet] [--pong] gnatsd_host gnatsd_port`

### Options:

* `-q` or `--quiet`: Suppress output
* `--ping`: Enable automatically sending a `PONG` message to gnatsd
when a `PING` message is received (to keep the connection alive).

### Examples

Works with pipes:

```
$ printf 'connect {}\r\nping\r\n' | ./catnats.py -q demo.nats.io 4443
```

And without:

```
$ ./catnats.py --pong demo.nats.io 4443
```

Publish time and date every 5 seconds:

```
$ while true; do time=`date` && \
  printf "PUB device-time.$(hostname) ${#time}\r\n${time}\r\n" | \
  catnats --pong --quiet demo.nats.io 4443; sleep 5; done
```
